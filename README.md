# CocoaPodsSlack

An alternative native OS X wrapper for the CocoaPods Slack.

This is useful if you want to have it open independently from the many
other Slacks you might have added to the official app.

Created using [AppBurger][1] and uses an icon created by @orta.

## Usage

```bash
$ xcodebuild
$ cp -a build/Release/CocoaPodsSlack.app /Applications
$ open /Applications/CocoaPodsSlack.app
```
